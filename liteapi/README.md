# liteapi

## Overview

liteapi is a powerful and easy to use service of [litestorm](https://github.com/Kleinmarb/litestorm) to create REST APIs.
Designed with performance in mind, liteapi is highly multithreaded and asynchronous, allowing you to build fast and responsive APIs with ease.
With its user-friendly interface and intuitive design, liteapi makes it easy to get started building your own APIs. Whether youâ€™re an experienced developer or just getting started, liteapi provides the tools you need to create powerful and scalable REST APIs.

## Features

liteapi gives you a lot of flexibility by having to return a http-response with the given enum and taking the query-params as an argument,
this sounds redundant but by doing that you can give the handler function way more flexibility than in other frameworks.
Let's make a simple REST API using liteapi that asks for an apikey as a query-param (don't ask for an apikey as a query-param in production):

``` rust
use liteapi::{LiteAPI, http, entry, json, json2string};

entry! {
    LiteAPI::new().await
        .get("/", index).await
        .run().await;
}

// Note that every handler has to take query-pairs as the one and only argument.
// Also note that the handler can't be asynchronous.
fn index(q: http::QueryParams) -> http::Response {
    match q.get("apikey") {
        None => {
            http::Response::Plain(http::StatusCode::Forbidden.detail("Please provide an apikey!"))
        },

        Some(apikey) => {
            let secret_apikey = "1234"; // Please dont do this in production
            if apikey == secret_apikey {
                let json = json!({"Hello, ": "World!"});
                http::Response::Json(json2string(&json).unwrap())
                // Also note that there is a json2string macro with which you can turn anything into json in liteapi
            } else {
                http::Response::Plain(http::StatusCode::Forbidden.detail("The apikey is wrong!"))
            }
        }
    }
}


// That's it this api will wait for a request on the default path and give a Forbidden if the apikey is not provided or wrong
```


Let's add another route to this RESTAPI this time we are going to return some html!

```rust
use liteapi::{LiteAPI, http, entry, html2string, json, json2string};

entry! {
    LiteAPI::new().await
        .get("/", index).await
        .get("/template", template).await // Dont forget to add the route here
        .run().await;
}

// Note that every handler has to take query-pairs as the one and only argument.
// Also note that the handler can't be asynchronous.
fn index(query: http::QueryParams) -> http::Response {
    match query.get("apikey") {
        None => {
            http::Response::Plain(http::StatusCode::Forbidden.detail("Please provide an apikey!"))
        },

        Some(apikey) => {
            let secret_apikey = "1234"; // Please dont do this in production
            if apikey == secret_apikey {
                let json = json!({"Hello, ": "World!"});
                http::Response::Json(json2string(&json).unwrap())
                // Also note that there is a json2string macro with which you can turn anything into json in liteapi
            } else {
                http::Response::Plain(http::StatusCode::Forbidden.detail("The apikey is wrong!"))
            }
        }
    }
}

// Here you can see even though we are not working with the query-pairs we have to take them as an argument
fn template(_: http::QueryParams) -> http::Response {
    let html = html2string(r"path\to\template.html").expect("Error reading the html!");
    http::Response::Html(html)
}

// This was very easy right? Imagine the possibilities combining these two routes
```

Here are some more features, that are going to follow soon:

- liteapi already provides auto OpenAPI documentation just visit localhost:7878/openapi.json/ but it is not customizable yet
- support for http2.0 and http3.0
- support for custom middleware
- support for oauth2 
- support for websockets
- support for positional query params: localhost:7878/{id}/{name}/
